Here is the requested information for your market research, formatted as JSON.

**Market Context:**

1.  **Typical Hourly Rate:** Businesses typically pay **$15-25/hr** for manual data entry, with an average loaded cost (including overhead) closer to $25-35/hr.
2.  **Estimated Monthly Volume:** A single full-time data entry role can process between **10,000 and 30,000 records** per month, depending on the complexity of each entry. This represents a 160-hour/month workload.
3.  **Potential Monthly Revenue Per Client:** Your target SaaS or service fee of **$500 - $1,500 per month** per client is a highly attractive alternative to a full-time or even part-time hire.
4.  **The ROI Pitch:** "A full-time data entry clerk costs over $3,200/month (160 hrs x $20/hr) plus overhead. Our automation solution performs the same work 24/7 with higher accuracy for a flat fee of $750/month. You save over 75% on direct costs, eliminate human error, and free up your team for higher-value tasks."
